# Pedigree

This app was originally forked from [ipfs-service-provider, cjs branch](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-service-provider/tree/cjs). That boilerplate repo provides a REST API server and JSON RPC over IPFS server. The front-end is expected to communicate with the REST API, and peers wanting to collaborate on CoinJoin transactions communicate over the IPFS JSON RPC.
